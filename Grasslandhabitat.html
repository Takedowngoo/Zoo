<p>Here is a quote from Kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/grassland">
    Grasslands are usually found in the dry interior of continents,<br>
    between the mountains and deserts. Many grasslands were<br>
    formed tens of thousands of years ago after the last ice age,<br>
    when the Earth began to warm up and the climate became drier.

<p>Quote from kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/lion">
    Lion prides can be as small as 3 or as big as 40 animals. In a pride, lions<br>
    hunt prey, raise cubs, and defend their territory together. In prides the<br>
    females do most of the hunting and cub rearing. Usually all the<br>
    lionesses in the pride are relatedâ€”mothers, daughters, grandmothers,<br>
    and sisters.

<p>Cheetah picture by David Groves</p>
<p>Quote from Kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/cheetah">
    The cheetah's excellent eyesight helps it find prey during the day. The<br>
    cheetah is hard to see because its spotted coat blends with the tall,<br>
    dry grass of the plains. Suddenly, the cheetah makes a lightning dash.<br>
    It knocks its prey to the ground and then bites its throat. Once found<br>
    throughout Asia and Africa, cheetahs today are racing toward<br>
    extinction. Loss of habitat and declining numbers of their prey<br>
    combine to threaten the future of these cats. Cheetahs live and hunt<br>
    mainly in open grasslands and bushy areas in parts of Africa and the Middle East.
