<p>Here is a quote from Kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="">
    Oceans are areas of salty water that fill enormous basins on<br>
    the Earth’s surface. Even though Earth has one continuous<br>
    body of saltwater, scientists and geographers divide it into<br>
    five different sections. From biggest to smallest, they are the<br>
    Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian, the Southern, and the Arctic Oceans.

<p>Quote from kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/facts/hammerhead-shark">
    A hammerhead shark uses its wide head to trap stingrays by pinning<br>
    them to the seafloor. The shark's eye placement, on each end of its<br>
    very wide head, allows it to scan more area more quickly than other<br>
    sharks can. The hammerhead also has special sensors across its head<br>
    that helps it scan for food in the ocean. Living creatures' bodies give<br>
    off electrical signals, which are picked up by sensors on the prowling hammerhead.

<p>Quote from Kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/bottlenose-dolphin">
    Bottlenose dolphins squeak, squawk and use body language—leaping<br>
    as high as 20 feet in the air, snapping their jaws, slapping their tails on<br>
    the surface of the water, blowing bubbles and even butting heads.<br>
    Each dolphin has a special whistle that it creates soon after it is born.<br>
    This whistle is used for identification, just like a human’s name.<br>
    Dolphins also produce high frequency clicks, which act as a sonar<br>
    system called echolocation (ek-oh-low-KAY-shun). When the clicking<br>
    sounds hit an object in the water, like a fish or rock, they bounce off<br>
    and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the<br>
    dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object.
