<p>Here is a quote from Kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/rain-forest">
    Rainforests are lush, warm, wet habitats. Trees in the rainforest<br>
    grow very tall because they have to compete with other<br>
    plants for sunlight. Kapok trees, which are found in tropical<br>
    rainforests around the world, can grow to 200 feet. The tallest<br>
    trees spread their branches and leaves blocking the light from<br>
    the trees below, and creating a canopy over the forest. When<br>
    one of the big trees dies and falls, the opening lets in more<br>
    sunlight so that a smaller tree can grow and take its place.

<p>Quote from kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/jaguar">
    Unlike many other cats, jaguars do not avoid water; in fact, they are<br>
    a quite good swimmers. Rivers provide prey in the form of fish, turtles,<br>
    or caimans—small, alligatorlike animals. Jaguars also eat larger animals<br>
    such as deer, peccaries, capybaras, and tapirs. They sometimes climb<br>
    trees to prepare an ambush, killing their prey with one powerful bite.

<p>Quote from Kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/amphibians/facts/poison-dart-frog">
    With a range of bright colors—yellows, oranges, reds, greens, blues—<br> poison dart frogs aren't just big show-offs either. Those colorful<br>  designs tell potential predators, "I'm toxic. Don't eat me." For example,<br>  the golden poison dart frog has enough poison to kill 20,000 mice.<br>  Scientists think that poison dart frogs get their toxicity from some of the insects they eat.
