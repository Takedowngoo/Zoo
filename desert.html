<p>Here is a quote from Kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/desert">
    Many deserts were formed 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.<br>
    Some are superhot in the day. In fact the highest<br>
    temperature ever recorded on Earth was 134°F (56.6°C)<br>
    in California and Nevada's Death Valley in 1913. Even<br>
    though many deserts can reach temperatures of<br>
    well over 100°F (37.8°C) during the day in summer, they can<br>
    get cold at night. Why? In most places, clouds and<br>
    water vapor hold in heat, sort of like a blanket. But<br>
    deserts don’t have enough clouds and water vapor to<br>
    do this.

<p>Quote from kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/bactrian-camel">
    Bactrian camels have two humps on their backs where they store fat. Their<br>
    nostrils close to block sand, and their bushy eyebrows and two rows of<br>
    long eyelashes protect their eyes from blowing sand and ice.

<p>Regal Horned Lizard by Pierre Bamin</p>
<p>Quote from Kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/facts/regal-horned-lizard">
    But nothing compares to squirting blood on command! As a last resort,<br>
    the reptiles are able to burst the blood vessels near their eyeballs to<br>
    trigger a surprise spray. They aim the blood toward the predator’s<br>
    mouth—it’s the bad taste that sends enemies running. Talk about an<br>
    eye-popping surprise!
