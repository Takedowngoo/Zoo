<p>Here is a quote from Kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/mountain">
    Mountains are on every continent. The longest mountain<br>
    range is over 40,000 miles long—and 90 percent is under the<br>
    ocean! Called the Mid-Ocean Ridge, it wraps around the globe<br>
    like the seams of a baseball. The longest aboveground<br>
    mountain range is the Andes. Running along the entire west<br>
    coast of South America through seven different countries—<br>
    including Argentina, Chile, and Colombia—it’s 4,700 miles long.

<h2>Some animals that live in the mountain habitat</h2>
<h3>Snow Leopard</h3>

<p>Quote from kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/snow-leopard">
    A snow leopard peers down from a craggy rock ledge high in the peaks of<br>
    Mongolia, a country in Asia. She’s on the lookout for a snack. The animal’s<br>
    spotted beige fur allows her to blend in almost completely with the rocks,<br>
    making the cat a nearly invisible hunter. Noticing a wild goat grazing<br>
    below, the feline creeps across the ledge on her silent, furry footpads.<br>
    Then she rockets down the slope. The wild goat scrambles to escape. But<br>
    with one 30-foot leap the cat catches up and pounces. Seconds later, she’s<br>
    secured her meal and looks for a place to dine.

<p>Quote from Kids National Geographic's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/mountain-gorilla">
    Mountain gorillas spend much of their time eating. Their food includes<br>
    a variety of plants, along with a few insects and worms. At night the<br>
    animals make a nest to sleep in. Many lightweight gorillas nest in trees,<br>
    making beds of bent branches. The heavier individuals may nest in<br>
    grasses on the ground. Babies snuggle with their mothers for the night.
